# Snake Xenzia Game Simulation with Queues

## Slide 1: Introduction
- **Title:** "Snake Xenzia Game Simulation with Queues"
- Briefly introduce the Snake Xenzia game and the concept of simulating its movement using a queue data structure.

## Slide 2: First Diagram Explanation
- **Title:** "Initial Game State"
- **Description:**
  - Display the first diagram with the snake segments (numbered 1, 2, 3) and the food.
  - Explain how the numbers represent the order of snake segments in the queue.
  - Describe the yellow boxes as representing the snake segments in the queue.
  - Discuss the movement of the snake from left to right.

## Slide 3: Second Diagram Explanation
- **Title:** "Snake Change in Direction"
- **Description:**
  - Display the second diagram with the updated snake segments (numbers 3, 1, 2) and the food.
  - Explain the change in direction and how it is reflected in the queue.
  - Emphasize the shifting of elements in the queue to simulate the snake's movement.

## Slide 4: Queue Data Structure
- **Title:** "Queue Representation"
- **Description:**
  - Briefly explain the queue data structure and
